Compound governance refers to the process by which decisions are made about the management and operation of the Compound protocol, a decentralized platform for earning interest on and borrowing cryptocurrency.

The Compound protocol is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. As a DAO, it is governed by its users, who participate in the decision-making process through a voting system.

Users of the Compound protocol can propose changes or improvements to the protocol through a process called "proposal submission." These proposals are then reviewed and discussed by the community, and if a proposal reaches a certain level of support, it is put to a vote. Users can then cast their votes in favor of or against the proposal. If a proposal receives a sufficient number of votes, it is implemented.

Compound governance allows users of the protocol to have a say in the direction and development of the platform, and helps to ensure that the platform remains aligned with the needs and interests of its users.
