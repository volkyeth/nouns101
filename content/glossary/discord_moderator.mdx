# Discord Moderator

A Discord moderator is a member of a Discord server who has been assigned specific privileges and responsibilities for managing and maintaining the server. A server moderator has access to a range of tools and features that allow them to manage and control the server, including the ability to manage other users, moderate content, and enforce rules and policies.&#x20;

Moderators are typically chosen by the server owner or other administrators, and are expected to act in the best interests of the server and its community.
