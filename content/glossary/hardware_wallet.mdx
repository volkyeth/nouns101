Hardware wallets are physical devices which enhances the security of your crypto.

Remember: Hardware wallets don't store your crypto!

Instead, hardware wallets store your private keys - and require physical confirmation whenever you interact with the blockchain.

For example, you need to confirm (by clicking on your physical device) whenever you transfer crypto out of your hardware wallet.

Hardware wallets cost anywhere from $100-$500. It definitely is a good investment when your portfolio has reached a certain size!
