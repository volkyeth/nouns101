# Hot wallet

A hot wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet. Hot wallets are typically software wallets that are installed on a device, such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet, and are used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Because hot wallets are connected to the internet, they are considered to be more convenient and user-friendly than cold wallets, which are offline and not connected to the internet. However, because hot wallets are connected to the internet, they are also considered to be less secure than cold wallets. It is generally recommended that users only store a small amount of their cryptocurrencies in a hot wallet, and keep the majority of their funds in a cold wallet for added security.
