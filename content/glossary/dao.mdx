# DAO

DAO, also known as Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a group of people working together to achieve a common goal.

Most DAOs are token-gated, and only allow holders of their cryptocurrency or NFT to enter the DAO.

At Lil Nouns, anybody can enter our Discord and join the community. However, only holders of Lil Nouns NFTs can participate in governance-related activities, such as voting on proposals.
