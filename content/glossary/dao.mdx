DAO, also known as Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a group of people working together to achieve a targeted goal.

Most DAOs are token-gated, and only allow holders of their cryptocurrency or NFT to enter the DAO.

At Lil Nouns, anybody can enter our Discord, but holders of Lil Nouns can participate in other governance-related activities.
