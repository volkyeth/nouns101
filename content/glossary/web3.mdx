Web3 is the third generation of web technologies, which focuses on the integration of the decentralized web. Instead of relying on centralized authorities to control the flow of information on the web, web3 technologies enable users to interact with each other directly, using decentralized networks and protocols. This allows for greater security, privacy, and autonomy on the web, as well as the ability to build new types of applications and services that were not possible with previous generations of web technology, like <Nutshell children="NFTs" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft.mdx" /> and the Metaverse.

Web3 generally refers to the ecosystem of all things crypto.
