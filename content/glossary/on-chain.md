# On-chain

On-chain refers to digital assets that reside on the blockchain.

In the NFT world, many creators choose to store NFTs and their metadata (or details) outside the blockchain, off-chain, mainly for lowering the costs of creating a collection.

However, it is still possible to upload full NFT collections, metadata included, to the blockchain. At Nouns and Lil Nouns, our NFTs are all fully on-chain.
