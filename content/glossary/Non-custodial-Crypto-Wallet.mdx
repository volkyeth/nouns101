title: Non-custodial Crypto Wallet
---

A non-custodial crypto wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet where the user is solely responsible for managing their private keys. This means that the user has complete control over their cryptocurrency assets, as they are the only one with access to the private keys needed to access and spend them. In contrast, a custodial wallet is one where the private keys are managed by a third party, such as an exchange or other financial institution.&#x20;

However, this also means that the user is responsible for backing up their private keys and protecting them from being lost or stolen. Some examples of non-custodial wallets include hardware wallets and software wallets that are downloaded and installed on a user's device.
