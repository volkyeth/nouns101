A crypto wallet is a digital wallet that is used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency. It is a software program that interacts with the blockchain, the distributed ledger that records all transactions made using a particular cryptocurrency. Each crypto wallet has a unique set of keys, which are used to access and manage the cryptocurrency stored within the wallet.
