# PropLot

PropLot references the Lil Nouns DAO Ideas Board, where a Lil Noun token holder can add ideas, which are then voted up or down via token-weighted voting.&#x20;

In some cases, this is just to signal if an idea is worth pursuing. In other cases, this may be to gain sponsorship to bring an idea forward to NounsDAO with Lil Nouns DAO Nouns token holdings.
