###### Discord is a voice, video, and text chat app that's been adopted by web3, crypto, and NFT communities. In many cases NFT projects create Discord Servers to host their project, and various chat rooms for conversation around the project.&#x20;

Discord Servers may have <Nutshell children="token gated" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/token_gated.mdx" /> chat rooms, and require you to verify your assets through a service like Guild. It is EXTREMELY important you verify that these are official bots and verification services before doing so. Discord Servers have <Nutshell children="moderators" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/discord_moderator.mdx" />  you can ask, before verifying if you're unsure.

The best place to start on a Discord Server is General Chat. Say hello to the community and let them know if you have any questions.&#x20;

Note: Before joining any community be 100% its the official group or project. Web3 is ripe with scams and bad actors. &#x20;
