Rarible is a marketplace for buying and selling unique digital items, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a specific item, such as a piece of artwork, a collectible, or a virtual real estate property. They are stored on a blockchain and can be bought and sold like any other asset.

Rarible is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that all transactions on the platform are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and are transparent and secure. Users can create and list their own NFTs for sale on the platform, or they can browse and purchase NFTs created by other users.
