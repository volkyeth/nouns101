A multi-sig wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that uses multi-sig technology to add an additional layer of security to the storage and management of digital assets.

In a multi-sig wallet, multiple private keys are associated with a single address. In order to access the funds stored at that address, more than one of the private keys must be used to sign a transaction. This means that multiple parties must be involved in the approval process for any transaction involving the funds in the wallet.

Multi-sig wallets can be useful in a variety of situations, such as when multiple people need to be involved in the management of a shared set of funds, or when additional security is desired to prevent unauthorized access to assets. They can also be used in corporate settings, where multiple approvals may be required before a transaction can be executed.
