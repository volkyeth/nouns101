# Transaction

In the world of cryptocurrencies, a transaction is a record of a transfer of value between two or more parties. Transactions are typically recorded on a blockchain, and are verified and processed by network participants using cryptographic algorithms.&#x20;

Transactions are an essential part of the functioning of cryptocurrencies, as they allow users to transfer value and ownership of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), between different accounts and addresses.&#x20;

The abbreviation "txn" is often used in discussions about cryptocurrencies, and can be used to refer to any type of transaction, such as a transfer of funds, a smart contract execution, or an NFT minting or transfer.
