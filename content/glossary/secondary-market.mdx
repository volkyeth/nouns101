The "secondary" NFT market refers to the network of exchanges, platforms, and other online venues where NFTs can be bought, sold, or traded after they have been minted and added to a blockchain. The primary market for NFTs is the platform or marketplace where they are initially created and sold by their creators.



The secondary market is where NFTs can be traded and their ownership transferred after they have been purchased on the primary market. The secondary market is where most of the buying and selling of NFTs takes place and where their prices are determined.
