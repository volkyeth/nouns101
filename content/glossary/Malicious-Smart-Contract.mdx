title: Malicious Smart Contract
---

A malicious smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms that are intentionally designed to exploit or harm the users of the contract. Smart contracts are programmed to automatically execute the terms of an agreement when certain conditions are met. They are often used to facilitate transactions or exchanges of value on a blockchain network.

Malicious smart contracts can take many forms, and common examples include contracts that steal funds or tokens from users, execute unintended actions, impose unexpected or unreasonable terms, and deny access to funds or assets.&#x20;

It is important to be cautious when interacting with smart contracts, as they can potentially have serious consequences if they are not carefully designed and reviewed. It is always a good idea to thoroughly read and understand the terms and conditions of a smart contract before interacting with it.
