DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) governance refers to the process by which decisions are made and actions are taken within a DAO. A DAO is a type of organization that is run entirely on a blockchain and is managed by a set of smart contracts. It is designed to be self-governed and decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by a single individual or entity.

DAO governance typically involves a combination of voting and smart contracts. Token holders in the DAO are usually given the right to vote on proposals and decisions related to the organization. These votes are often conducted using a smart contract that is designed to ensure that the voting process is transparent and secure.
