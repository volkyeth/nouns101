First there were Nouns.

Then there were Lil Nouns.

Next came bitNouns.

An expansion DAO based on Lil Nouns DAO, bitNouns works to create another layer within the Nounish ecosystem; The teeniest tiniest Noun yet.&#x20;

By expanding the ecosystem, bitNouns aims at exposing more people to Lil Nouns, and in turn Nouns DAO/the entire Nounish ecosystem via a practically free way to participate.
