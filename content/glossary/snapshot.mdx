A snapshot is a term used in the context of blockchain technology to refer to a point-in-time record of the state of the blockchain. A snapshot typically includes information such as the current block height, the current block hash, the current state of all accounts and balances, and any other relevant data. Snapshots are often used for various purposes, such as for backup and recovery, for historical analysis and research, or for creating new blockchain forks or networks. Snapshots can be taken manually, or can be automated using specialized software or protocols. In the context of cryptocurrencies, a snapshot might also refer to a record of the balances of all accounts on a particular blockchain at a specific point in time, which is used for distributing a new token or asset to existing holders.
