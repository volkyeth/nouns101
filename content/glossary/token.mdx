A "token" is a digital asset that is represented by a non-fungible token (NFT) on a blockchain. An NFT is a unique and indivisible digital asset that represents ownership of a specific item or piece of digital content. NFT tokens are commonly used to represent items such as digital art, collectibles, in-game items, and other forms of digital ownership. NFTs are often bought and sold on online marketplaces, and their value can fluctuate depending on demand and other factors. Because NFT tokens are unique and indivisible, they cannot be divided or exchanged for other tokens or assets on a one-to-one basis like other cryptocurrencies. This makes them particularly well-suited for representing digital items that are unique and valuable.
