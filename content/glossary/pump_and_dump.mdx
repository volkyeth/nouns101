Pump & Dump is when a token's price is inflated unrealistically high very quickly, before tumbling all the way back down.

In most situations, scammers are hyping a token causing many people to buy it. However, they sell a huge percentage of tokens shortly after, thereby crashing its price.

This is also called a "rug-pull" when scammers run away with the cash and cheat holders with false promises.
