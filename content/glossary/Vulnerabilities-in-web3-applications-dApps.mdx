Web3 applications, or dApps, are decentralized and open-source, which means that anyone can access and audit the code that powers them.

However, this also means that vulnerabilities and bugs in the code can be exploited by hackers, gaining access to sensitive information or to perform unauthorized actions.

As a precautionary measure, DYOR before connecting your wallet to any dApp.
