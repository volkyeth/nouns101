Avalanche is a next-generation blockchain platform that enables the creation and management of multiple independent subnets, called Avalanche-X, each with its own consensus, governance, and virtual machines. Avalanche aims to provide a solution for the scalability, interoperability, and security challenges of current blockchain networks by allowing for the creation of customized, high-performance subnets for different use cases. It is one of the projects that are based on Ethereum and supported by MetaMask, enabling users to interact with the Ethereum-compatible Avalanche blockchain.
