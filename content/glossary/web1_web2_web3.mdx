Web1, also known as the "static web," was the first generation of the web and consisted of simple, static websites that were essentially online brochures. These websites were primarily used for sharing information and were not interactive.

Web2, also known as the "dynamic web," was the second generation of the web and introduced more interactive and dynamic features. This included the ability for users to interact with each other and with the content on a website, through things like comments, forums, and social media.

Web3, also known as the "decentralized web", builds on the interactivity and dynamic features of web2, but adds the key feature of decentralization. This means that instead of relying on centralized servers and authorities to manage and control the flow of information on the web, web3 technologies enable users to interact with each other directly, using decentralized networks and protocols. This allows for greater security, privacy, and autonomy on the web, as well as the ability to build new types of applications and services that were not possible with previous generations of web technology.
