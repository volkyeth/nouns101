title: 'CH2: Revoke Allowances'
---

[
https://revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash/) is a great tool that allows you to see the allowances granted for each token in your wallet (your crypto and NFTs).

Search, or connect with your wallet address to revoke all access from contracts your wallet has interacted with in one shot.

Note: That marketplaces, like Opensea require you to grant allowances to a collection to sell them. These allowances are typically fine, and are not vulnerabilities.
