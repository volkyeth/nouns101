Smart contracts are protocols which executes itself, upon certain parameters being hit.

They are pre-programmed to execute an action, like transferring $1000 to Elon Musk, upon receiving a specific input, for example if the majority of members in a DAO vote "Yes" to that.

Smart contracts reside on the blockchain, so it's details are free to view by the public.

This is crucial in DAOs - since smart contracts are the executioner, there is no point "voting" or "governing" if the smart contract is fraudulent.
