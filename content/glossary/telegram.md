# Telegram

A Telegram community is a group of people who are connected through the Telegram messaging platform. Telegram is a popular messaging app that is known for its focus on security and privacy, and is often used by communities, organizations, and businesses to communicate and collaborate with their members or customers. A Telegram community can be created by any Telegram user who wants to connect with others who share their interests or goals. Communities can be private, meaning that only members can see and participate in the group, or public, meaning that anyone can see the group and its messages. Telegram communities can be used for a wide range of purposes, including sharing information, organizing events, or providing support and assistance to members.
