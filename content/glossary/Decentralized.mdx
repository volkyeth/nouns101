title: Decentralized
---

Decentralized refers to a system or network that is not controlled by a single, central authority, but rather operates on a distributed network of computers or nodes. In a decentralized system, authority and decision-making power is distributed among the various nodes in the network, rather than being concentrated in a single central authority. This can give decentralized systems greater resilience and security, as there is no single point of failure that can compromise the entire system. Decentralization is often associated with blockchain technology, where it is used to create secure and transparent record-keeping systems that are not controlled by a single entity. However, decentralization can also be applied to other systems and networks, such as peer-to-peer networks, distributed computing systems, and even social networks.
