"Minting" an NFT refers to the process of creating a new non-fungible token and adding it to a blockchain. This typically involves creating a digital asset, such as a piece of art or a collectible item, and then using specialized software to generate a unique cryptographic token that represents ownership of that asset. The token is then added to the blockchain, where it can be bought, sold, or traded like any other digital asset.
