title: 'bitNouns: A Free Governance Token'
hide: true
---

bitNouns was formed as a way to give new web3 participants a way to participate in a Lil Nouns DAO governance at a *\*practically* free cost of entry.&#x20;

bitNouns was started with just 1 Lil Noun delegated to them by the bitNounders. But the hope is to grow the number of Lil Nouns or even Nouns delegated to them over time.&#x20;

bitNoun token holders will use their votes to vote on Lil Nouns DAO Proposals, which can be found here: [https://lilnouns.wtf/vote.](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote)

**Where can you participate with your bitNouns?**

bitNouns make their home in the **Lil Nouns DAO server.** To get started, join the server here: [https://discord.gg/lilnouns](https://discord.gg/lilnouns)











**...More on how to verify for a bitNouner Role and to vote, coming soon...**

*\*bitNouns utilizes Nouns.Build which has a .0001 ETH reserve free + gas.*
