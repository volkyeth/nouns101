Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors when logging in to an account or accessing a protected system. The goal of 2FA is to provide an additional layer of security beyond just a password, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information or systems.
