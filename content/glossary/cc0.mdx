CC0 (pronounced "CC zero") is a public domain dedication developed by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/). It is a legal tool that allows creators to waive all their \[\[copyright]] and related rights in their works and dedicate them to the public domain.

This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the works without any legal restrictions or limitations, as long as they do not imply that the creator endorses their use of the work.

By using CC0, creators can give others maximum freedom to use and build upon their works, without having to worry about the legal complexities of copyright law. This can make it easier for others to use, share, and build upon the works, potentially leading to new and innovative creations.

To use CC0, creators can apply the dedication to their works using the CC0 public domain dedication tool, which is available on the Creative Commons website. Once the dedication has been applied, the work is considered to be in the public domain and can be used by anyone in accordance with the terms of the dedication.

While this may sound bad for artists at first, it really isn't. Besides eliminating the need to constantly track down art thieves, CC0 NFTs spread around best - because they're free for anyone to use, modify, and commercialize.

Nouns DAO is a pioneer in CC0 NFTs, and Lil Nouns have followed suit. At Nouns, we've created a CC0 culture that encourages proliferation, spreading the word about Nouns.
