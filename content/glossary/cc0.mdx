CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) is a protocol which strips creations of their I.P.

While this may sound bad for artists at first, it really isn't.

Besides eliminating the need to constantly track down art thiefs, CC0 NFTs spread around best - because they're free for anyone to use, modify, commercialize.

Nouns DAO is a pioneer in CC0 NFTs, and Lil Nouns have followed suit. At Nouns, we've created a CC0 culture which encourages proliferation, spreading the word about Nouns.
