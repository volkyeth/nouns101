Defi, short for "decentralized finance," refers to a movement that aims to use blockchain technology and smart contracts to enable financial transactions and services in a decentralized manner. The goal of Defi is to create an open and inclusive financial system that is not controlled by any single entity or organization, and that allows individuals and organizations to interact and transact with one another directly, without the need for intermediaries.

Defi encompasses a wide range of financial applications and services, including peer-to-peer lending, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and more. It is often associated with the use of cryptocurrency and other digital assets, and is seen as a way to disrupt traditional financial systems and bring greater financial accessibility and inclusion to people around the world.
