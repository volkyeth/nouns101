Optimism is a company that develops a layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. The Optimism Virtual Machine (OVM) enables fast, cheap, and secure execution of smart contracts on Ethereum. It uses a technique called "optimistic rollups" to bundle multiple transactions into a single, cheaper transaction on the main Ethereum chain, which reduces the cost and increases the speed of transactions on the network. It is one of the projects that are based on Ethereum and supported by MetaMask, enabling users to interact with the Ethereum-compatible Optimism blockchain.
