Intangible refers to non-physical assets or values that are stored on a blockchain and can be represented by a digital token or smart contract. Web3 technologies, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enable the creation and exchange of intangible assets, such as digital currencies, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
