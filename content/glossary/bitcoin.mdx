# Bitcoin

Bitcoin (commonly abbreviated as BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous individual known to be the "Father of Crypto".&#x20;

Transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded on a public, tamper-resistant ledger called the \[\[blockchain]], which uses a \[\[proof-of-work]] consensus mechanism to validate and process transactions.&#x20;

Bitcoins can be bought and sold for FIAT currency or other cryptocurrencies, and are often used as an investment or medium of exchange. The production of new bitcoins is called \[\[mining]] and is performed by powerful computers that compete to solve complex computational puzzles.
