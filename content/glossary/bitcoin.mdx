Bitcoin (commonly abbreviated as BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. It was created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto." Transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded on a public, tamper-evident ledger called the [[blockchain]], which uses a [[proof-of-work]] consensus mechanism to validate and process transactions. [[Bitcoins]] can be bought and sold for fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies, and are often used as an investment or a store of value. The production of new bitcoins is called [[mining]] and is performed by powerful computers that compete to solve complex computational puzzles.
