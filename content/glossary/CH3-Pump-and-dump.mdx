A "pump and dump" scheme refers to a fraudulent investment scheme in which the price of an NFT is artificially inflated through false and misleading statements, in order to sell the NFT at a higher price. This type of scheme is illegal and can be harmful to investors who may purchase the NFT at the inflated price, only to see its value drop significantly once the true nature of the scheme is revealed. It's important to be cautious and do your own research before investing in any NFT, and to be aware of the potential risks involved. If you suspect that you may have been a victim of a pump and dump scheme involving NFTs, you should report it to the relevant authorities.

In some cases the "pump" might not come from the NFT creators, but rather from buyers, sellers, and influencers who attempt to influence the price of the market for that particular NFT.
