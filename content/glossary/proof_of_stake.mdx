Proof of Stake (commonly abbreviated as PoS) is a type of consensus mechanism used by some blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. In a proof of stake system, the creator of the next [[block]] on the [[blockchain]] is chosen in a deterministic way, depending on their stake in the cryptocurrency.

In contrast to [[proof of work]] systems, which use computational power to validate transactions and produce new blocks, proof of stake systems use a combination of random selection and stake (or ownership) to determine who will create the next block. This can make the process of validating transactions and producing new blocks more energy-efficient, as it does not require as much computational power.

One of the first cryptocurrencies to use proof of stake was Ethereum, which introduced a hybrid proof of work/proof of stake system in its 2016 "Casper" update. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Tezos and Cardano, also use proof of stake.
