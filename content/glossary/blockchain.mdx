A blockchain is a decentralized and secure digital ledger of transactions, or other types of data, that is stored on a network of computers or nodes. Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, the data it contains cannot be altered or deleted. This makes blockchain technology particularly suitable for recording financial transactions, as it provides a secure and transparent record of all activity.
