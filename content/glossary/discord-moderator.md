# Discord Moderator

A Discord moderator is a member of a Discord server who has been assigned specific privileges and responsibilities for managing and maintaining the server. Discord is a popular communication platform that is designed for online gaming communities, but is also used by a wide range of other communities, such as artists, educators, and hobbyists. Discord servers are created and managed by individual users, and can be private or public. As a member of a Discord server, a moderator has access to a range of tools and features that allow them to manage and control the server, including the ability to manage other users, moderate content, and enforce rules and policies. Moderators are typically chosen by the server owner or other administrators, and are expected to act in the best interests of the server and its community.
