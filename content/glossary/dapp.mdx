A dapp, or decentralized application, is a piece of software that runs on a decentralized network and uses [[blockchain]] technology to track and verify transactions on that network. This means that, unlike traditional applications, which are centrally hosted and managed, dapps are distributed across a network of computers, with no single point of control. This allows them to operate without the need for intermediaries, such as banks or other financial institutions.

One of the most popular platforms for building and deploying dapps is the [[Ethereum]] blockchain, which provides a decentralized virtual machine that can execute code in a distributed manner. Developers can use this virtual machine to create and deploy dapps that run on the Ethereum network, allowing them to take advantage of the security and transparency provided by blockchain technology.

Overall, dapps have the potential to revolutionize the way that we interact with software and online services, by providing a more secure, transparent, and decentralized alternative to traditional applications.
