# Proof of work vs Proof of stake

\[\[Proof of Work]] (PoW) and \[\[Proof of Stake]] (PoS) are two different types of consensus mechanisms used by some \[\[blockchain]]-based cryptocurrencies. These mechanisms are used to determine who will create the next block on the blockchain, and therefore play a crucial role in the functioning of these networks.

The main difference between PoW and PoS is the method by which the creator of the next block is chosen. In a PoW system, the creator of the next block is chosen based on their ability to solve a difficult computational problem, while in a PoS system, the creator is chosen based on their stake (or ownership) in the cryptocurrency.

PoW systems require miners to perform a significant amount of computational work in order to produce new blocks. In PoS systems, the amount of computational power required is significantly less. This makes PoS systems more energy-efficient and scalable than PoW systems.

Another difference between the two mechanisms is that PoS systems typically do not have a fixed reward for creating a new block. Instead, the reward is determined by a combination of the block creator's stake in the network and the age of their stake.

Both PoW and PoS have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which mechanism to use depends on the specific goals and requirements of the cryptocurrency network.
