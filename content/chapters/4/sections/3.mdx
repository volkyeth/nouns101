title: How Nouns DAO Works
---

**Taken directly from Nouns.wtf â€”**&#x20;

Nouns DAO utilizes a fork of <Nutshell children="Compound Governance" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/compound_governance.mdx" /> and is the main governing body of the Nouns ecosystem.

The Nouns DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily Noun auctions.

Each Noun is a member of Nouns DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters.

Noun votes are non-transferable (if you sell your Noun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your Noun.
