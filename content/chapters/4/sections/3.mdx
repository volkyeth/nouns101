title: How Do People Buy Nouns?
---

Unlike other PFP NFT projects, Nouns are auctioned off once [every day, forever](http://www.nouns.wtf).

The highest bidder after the 24-hour countdown ends, wins the Noun. Thereafter, the next Noun is minted during a community gathering, and the 24-hour countdown restarts.

In theory, this will go on forever, or as long as the Ethereum blockchain remains active or the protocol is voted on and changed.&#x20;

To **join in on the fun**, everyday there is a Twitter Spaces hosted by [The Nouns Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) where you can listen in while the current Noun auction ends, and help mint the next day's Noun using [fomonouns.wtf](https://fomonouns.wtf/)! The show is a lot of fun, community driven, and a great way to get involved ðŸŽ‰&#x20;
