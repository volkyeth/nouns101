title: How Nouns DAO Works
---

**Taken directly from Nouns.wtf** â€” Nouns DAO utilizes a fork of [[Compound Governance]] and is the main governing body of the Nouns ecosystem. 

The Nouns DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily Noun auctions. 

Each Noun is an irrevocable member of Nouns DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters. 

Noun votes are non-transferable (if you sell your Noun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your Noun.
