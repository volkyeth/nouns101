---

Currently, at the time of writing this (December, 2022) Nouns DAO tokens are selling for an average of ~30ETH.

It’s fair to say that many people are priced out, and unable to compete in these auctions, or become a Nouns DAO token holder.

**But that’s okay!**&#x20;

Although only token holders can vote on Nouns DAO proposals, everyone has a route to propose their ideas.
