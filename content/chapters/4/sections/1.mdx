title: Joining a DAO
---

In the last chapter we learned about DAOs and how they work.&#x20;

In this chapter we'll talk about getting involved.&#x20;

Typically, this just involved buying a DAO token, and joining the community.&#x20;

Although there are a number of DAOs you can join, we think <Nutshell children="Nounish DAOs" />  are pretty cool ;)

A Nounish DAO is any DAO in the Nouns ecosystem <Nutshell children="forking" /> the NounsDAO <Nutshell children="protocol." />

⌐◨-◨

Nouns DAO is an open-access web3 community, where anyone and everyone is encouraged to openly build upon this ecosystem.

Watch this quick explainer video by Ordinary Folk (a successfully funded proposal on Nouns DAO):
