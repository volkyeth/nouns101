title: Joining a DAO
---

In the last chapter we learned about NFT <Nutshell children="utility" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/utility.mdx" />, DAOs and how they work.&#x20;

**In this chapter we'll talk about getting involved in a DAO.**&#x20;

Although there are a number of DAOs you can join, we think <Nutshell children="Nounish" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Nounish.mdx" /> DAOs are pretty cool ;)

A Nounish DAO is any DAO in the Nouns ecosystem <Nutshell children="forking" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Fork.mdx" /> the NounsDAO <Nutshell children="protocol." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Protocol.mdx" />&#x20;

Nouns DAO itself utilizes a fork of <Nutshell children="compound governance" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/compound_governance.mdx" /> and is the main governing body of the Nouns ecosystem.

Nouns DAO is an open-access web3 community, where anyone and everyone is encouraged to openly build upon this ecosystem.
