title: What is Nouns DAO?
---

In the last chapter we learned about DAOs and how they work.&#x20;

Although there are a number of DAOs you can join, we think Nounish DAOs are pretty cool ;)&#x20;

Nouns DAO is an open-access web3 community, where anyone and everyone is encouraged to openly build upon this ecosystem.

Nouns are CC0 NFTs, where one Noun is generated every day, forever.
