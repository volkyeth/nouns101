title: What is Nouns DAO?
---

In the last chapter we learned about DAOs and how they work.&#x20;

In this chapter we'll talk about getting involved.&#x20;

Typically, this just involved buying a DAO token, and joining the community.&#x20;

Although there are a number of DAOs you can join, we think **Nounish DAOs** are pretty cool ;)&#x20;

A Nounish DAO is any DAO in the Nouns ecosystem taking advantage of a NounsDAO <Nutshell children="fork" />.

Nouns DAO is an open-access web3 community, where anyone and everyone is encouraged to openly build upon this ecosystem.

Nouns are CC0 NFTs, where one Noun is generated every day, forever.
