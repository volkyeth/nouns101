Despite only being founded in 2021, Nouns DAO has built quite a number of impressive projects!

**Nouns DAO has voted for and funded** a comic book series, produced luxury glasses, funded extreme athletes, designed a float for the Rose Bowl Parade, and even named a new species of frog: "Noun!"&#x20;

They have also funded development of tools, like <Nutshell children="Prop House," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/prop_house.mdx" /> a place for **anyone** with an Ethereum wallet to propose ideas - with the chance of getting funded.
