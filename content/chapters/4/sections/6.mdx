title: What Does Nouns Fund?
---


Despite only being founded in 2021, Nouns DAO has built quite a number of impressive projects.

For a start, we have built <Nutshell children="Prop House," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/prop_house.mdx" /> a place for ANYONE with an Ethereum wallet to propose ideas - with the chance of getting funded.

This has not only impacted the Nouns community, but also branched out to other communities such as <Nutshell children="OCM" />, <Nutshell children="Mfers" /> and <Nutshell children="Cryptoadz" />.

On top of that, Nouns DAO has commissioned a <Nutshell children="comic book series" />, produced <Nutshell children="luxury sunglasses" />, funded <Nutshell children="extreme athletes" /> and even <Nutshell children="named a newly discovered species of frog" />, “Noun”!
