title: What Does Nouns Fund?
---

Despite only being founded in 2021, Nouns DAO has built quite a number of impressive projects.

For a start, they have built <Nutshell children="Prop House," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/prop_house.mdx" /> a place for ANYONE with an Ethereum wallet to propose ideas - with the chance of getting funded.

This has not only impacted the Nouns community, but also branched out to many other communities. Visit [Prop.House](http://www.prop.house) for more info.

On top of that, Nouns DAO has commissioned a <Nutshell children="comic book series" />, produced <Nutshell children="luxury sunglasses" />, funded <Nutshell children="extreme athletes" /> and even <Nutshell children="named a newly discovered species of frog" />, “Noun”!
