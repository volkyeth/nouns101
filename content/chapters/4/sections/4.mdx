Here at Nouns DAO, we believe in consistently upgrading our infrastructure, continuous proliferation, and growing our unique culture.

All quality ideas are welcome; whether it be art, music, governance infrastructure, IRL projects, fun experiments, etc.

Ultimately, the DAO decides if we should want your idea to come to life.

If you’d like to contribute to Nouns DAO, here’s how you can start.
