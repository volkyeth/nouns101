Since Nouns artwork and protocol is CC0 many others have begun to fork the assets and code, and create more accessible ways to enter into the Nouns Ecosystem. 

Some of these routes include Sub-DAOs whose tokens are more affordable than Nouns DAO tokens, but allow you to participate in both Sub-DAO and Nouns DAO governance. 

Note: Add image here.

Prime examples of this are Lil Nouns DAO, Gnars DAO, and Wizard DAO. 

Each has their own governance structure, but also have their own Nouns DAO holdings.

This allows the communities to participate in Nouns DAO, through [[fractional ownership]], by purchasing Nouns as a group through voting. 

There are a number of ways you can get involved in the Nouns Ecosystem. In the following section we’ll go over how to join Lil Nouns DAO — Currently the largest Sub-DAO owner of Nouns DAO tokens.
