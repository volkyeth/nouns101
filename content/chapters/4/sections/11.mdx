It’s best to join in on the community, introduce yourself and get a sense for what the community is working on. **Ask questions, and don’t be shy!** — Remember, we’re all piloting this ship together!

**Ready to get started on your Nounish adventure, and have your ideas funded?**

To join Lil Nouns, get a Lil Noun from our auction site or via a Secondary marketplace like OpenSea.

You can even win Lil Nouns from some contests the DAO holds to give back to the community.

Join the Lil Nouns Discord. If you have already bought a Lil Nouns “verify” your wallet to get in touch with other <Nutshell children="holders" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/holder.mdx" />!
