Similar to Lil Nouns being the smaller, more affordable counterpart to Nouns, bitNouns allows users to experience minting a DAO token at a lower cost (0.0001 eth min bid + fees, set over a 5 minute auction).&#x20;

bitNouns holders will be able to verify for a #botNouner role in the Lil NounsDAO server, and will be able to vote on Lil Nouns DAO proposals via Lil Nouns DAO token delegation.
