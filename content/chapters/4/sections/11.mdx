Ready to get started on your Nounish adventure, and participate in Lil Nouns governance or have your ideas funded?

It’s best to join in on the community, introduce yourself and get a sense for what the community is working on. **Ask questions, and don’t be shy!** — Remember, we’re all piloting this ship together!

Head over to [https://lilnouns.wtf](https://lilnouns.wtf) to buy your first Lil Nouns DAO token.

You can even win Lil Nouns from contests the DAO holds to give back to the community.

If you've already bought a Lil Nouns “verify” your wallet through the #verify channel to get in touch with other <Nutshell children="holders" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/holder.mdx" /> in the #lil-nouner-private chat, and more!
