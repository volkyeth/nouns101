## Temperature Checking Your Ideas
Beware, in all DAOs, [[DAO politics]] do come into play — It’s not just about having a great idea; it’s about having the right idea for the current temperature of the DAO.
 
Before submitting an idea it’s important to ask yourself:
- Does the DAO have an appetite for this idea?
- Am I requesting too much or too little for compensation?
- Do I have the best interest of the DAO in mind?
 
Lil Nouns has numerous ways to propose and get feedback on ideas. [[PropLot]], various [[Discord channels]], and more — The process has evolved with the community over the first year.
