**Temperature Check Your Ideas:**

It’s not just about having a great idea; **it’s about having the right idea for the current temperature of the DAO.**

Before submitting an idea it’s important to ask yourself:

\#1. Does the DAO have an appetite for this idea?

\#2. Am I requesting too much or too little for compensation?

\#3. Do I have the best interest of the DAO in mind?

Lil Nouns has numerous ways to propose and get feedback on ideas. <Nutshell children="PropLot," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/proplot.mdx" /> various <Nutshell children="Discord channels," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/discord.mdx" /> and more — The process has evolved with the community over the first year, and continues to do so.
