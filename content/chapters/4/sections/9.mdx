title: How Can I Contribute to Lil Nouns DAO?
---

The best part for newbies about Lil Nouns: you don’t need to “join” the DAO to participate.

Yes, we encourage all builders (whether you have a Lil Noun or not) to contribute to the DAO, and get paid for your work.

Lil Nouns DAO, and the Nounish ecosystem believe in consistently upgrading our infrastructure, continuous proliferation, and growing our unique culture.

**All quality ideas are welcome;** whether it be art, music, governance infrastructure, IRL projects, fun experiments, etc.

It all starts with an idea, then a well-crafted proposal, and you’re right on track to turning that dream into reality.

Ultimately, the DAO decides if we should want your idea to come to life.
