title: How Can I Contribute to Lil Nouns DAO?
---

The best part for newbies about Lil Nouns: you don’t need to “join” the DAO to participate.

Yes, we encourage all builders (whether you have a Lil Noun or not) to contribute to the DAO, and get paid for your work.

**All quality ideas are welcome;** whether it be art, music, governance infrastructure, IRL projects, fun experiments, etc.

It all starts with an idea, then a well-crafted proposal, and you’re right on track to turning that dream into reality.

Ultimately, the DAO decides if they want your idea to come to life through voting.

The DAO has funded countless public goods (water purification kits, etc.), have “residents” helping run day-to-day operations, and has established our presence at various web3 events IRL.

Lil Nouns has also funded Data, Content, and Communication efforts - to conduct analysis, proliferate Lil Nouns, and engage the DAO.

They also funded this onboarding site you’re reading right now!&#x20;
