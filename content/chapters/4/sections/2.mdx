The Nouns protocol proliferates Nouns, with our ultimate goal being to make a lasting impact on governance and culture in the crypto space, and to the rest of the world.

* Nouns artwork is in the public domain.
* One Noun is trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours, forever.
* 100% of Noun auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to the treasury.
* Settlement of one auction kicks off the next.
* All Nouns are members of Nouns DAO.
* Nouns DAO uses a fork of Compound Governance.
* One Noun is equal to one vote.
* The treasury is controlled exclusively by Nouns via governance.
* Artwork is generative and stored directly on-chain (not IPFS).
* No explicit rules exist for attribute scarcity; all Nouns are equally rare.
* Nounders receive rewards in the form of Nouns (10% of supply for first 5 years).

Nouns DAO was created by the Nounders, and started with a “white paper” released by Punk4156 on Twitter:
