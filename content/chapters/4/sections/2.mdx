Unlike other PFP NFT projects, Nouns are auctioned off once every day, forever.

The highest bidder after the 24-hour countdown ends, wins the Noun. Thereafter, the next Noun is minted during a community gathering, and the 24-hour countdown restarts. This should go on forever, or at least till Ethereum shuts down.
