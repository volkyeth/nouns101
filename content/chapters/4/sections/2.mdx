title: What is Nouns DAO?
---

**In short — Each day one Noun is auctioned off 100% of the proceeds go to the Nouns DAO Treasury.** Nouns DAO token holders put up proposals and each Noun token is equal to one vote on how the treasury is spent. At the time of writing, the Nouns DAO treasury was worth ~33.5M in USD:

The Nouns protocol proliferates the Nouns<Nutshell children="meme," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Meme.mdx" /> with the ultimate goal being to make a lasting impact on governance and culture in the crypto space, and to the rest of the world.

▫ Nouns artwork is in the **public domain (CC0).**

▫ One Noun is trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours, **forever**.

▫ 100% of Noun auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to the treasury.

▫ Settlement of one auction kicks off the next.

▫ All Nouns are members of Nouns DAO.

▫ Nouns DAO uses a fork of Compound Governance.

**▫ One Noun** is equal to **one vote.**

▫ The treasury is controlled exclusively by Nouns via governance.

▫ Artwork is **generative** and stored directly **on-chain** (not IPFS).

▫ No explicit rules exist to attribute scarcity; all Nouns are equally rare.

▫ Nounders (Nouns Founders) receive rewards in the form of Nouns (10% of supply for first 5 years).

Nouns DAO was created by the Nounders, and started with a “white paper” released by Punk4156 on Twitter:
