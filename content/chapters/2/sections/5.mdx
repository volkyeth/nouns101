title: Minting NFTS
---

Minting in simple terms means creating an NFT on the blockchain.
 
So, you are the first owner of an NFT if you mint it.

You may have to pay higher gas fees to mint an NFT, compared to buying one off secondary marketplaces.
 
In [[NFT auctions]], you are minting NFTs most of the time. An example would be "settling auctions" on Lil Nouns' website.
