title: Minting NFTS
---


Minting in simple terms means **creating an NFT on the blockchain**. This means you're the first owner of an NFT if you *mint* it. This typically occurs on a NFT creators website, or "mint page."&#x20;

***Note: It's extremely important to make sure you're connected to a trusted site. If not, your assets could be compromised. ***

In <Nutshell children="NFT auctions" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_auction.mdx" /> like Nouns.wtf or LilNouns.wtf, you are <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/mint.mdx" children="minting" /> NFTs most of the time. An example would be "settling" the auction after one ends. This action not only transfers ownership of the current NFT to the auction winner, but also generates a new NFT that is minted to the blockchain and put up as the next auction.

In other cases, collection creators can mint the NFTs to the blockchain themselves, or through trusted 3rd party services like [Genfty](https://www.genfty.com/), or [Zora.co.](http://www.zora.co)
