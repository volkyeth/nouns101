title: Minting NFTS

Minting in simple terms means **creating an NFT on the blockchain**. So, you are the first owner of an NFT if you mint it.

In <Nutshell children="NFT auctions" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_auction.mdx" /> like Nouns.wtf or LilNouns.wtf, you are <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/mint.mdx" children="minting" /> NFTs most of the time. An example would be "settling" the auction after one ends. This action not only transfers ownership of the current NFT to the auction winner, but also generates a new NFT that is minted to the blockchain and put up as the next auction.

In other cases, collection creators generate and mint the NFTs to the blockchain themselves, or through 3rd party tools, [Zora.co.](http://www.zora.co)
