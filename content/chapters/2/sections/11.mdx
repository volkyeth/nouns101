title: Phishing attacks
---

A phishing attack occurs when a hacker tries to trick you into revealing sensitive information, such as your walletâ€™s private keys, by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity. 

In the web3 context, a phishing attack might involve the hacker sending you a fake email or message that appears to be from a legitimate web3 service, prompting you to enter sensitive information.

As such, phishing attacks are more human error than technological failure.
