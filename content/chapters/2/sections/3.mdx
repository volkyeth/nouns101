Sending vs Selling your NFT is akin to gifting an NFT versus flipping your NFT to potential buyers.

You can send NFTs directly from your crypto wallet (on mobile).

However, you'll need to list your NFTs on NFT Marketplaces to sell them.

**Sending NFTs**
To send an NFT, you need the recipient's wallet address, and some crypto to pay gas fees.

Most digital wallets only allow transfer of NFTs via mobile.

If you're on desktop, you have to find a [[third-party]] platform to transfer your NFTs.

**Selling NFTs**
Having a specific recipient is not necessary when selling NFTs.

Most commonly, you list your NFT on NFT marketplaces, and wait for potential buyers to give offers, or buy it outrightly.

You may have to pay a commission fee to the marketplace for facilitating the transaction and [[royalties]] to the creators.
