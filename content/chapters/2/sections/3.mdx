---

There are many ways to acquire an  NFT. You can even create one yourself! But, for the purposes of this course we'll stick to teaching you the basics;

\#2. In other cases you might know of a project that is <Nutshell children="minting" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/mint.mdx" />, that you'd like to buy into, or even claim for free.&#x20;

\#3. You might have a friend who would like to send you an NFT.
