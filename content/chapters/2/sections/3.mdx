title: How To Buy/Receive An NFT?
---

To buy an NFT, you will need some crypto and a crypto wallet. We went over how to get both in [Chapter 1](/chapters/1/1 "Chapter 1").

If a friend wants to send you an NFT, simply pass them your <Nutshell children="wallet address" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/wallet_address.mdx" />. In MetaMask you can find it and click to copy to your clipboard, seen below:

This is also the address you'll use to send yourself crypto from the <Nutshell children="hosted wallet" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/hosted_wallet.mdx" />, like <Nutshell children="Coinbase," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/coinbase.mdx" /> where you may have purchased your crypto.

For buying an NFT, there are 2 main methods: **Secondary Marketplaces **and** Minting** (more info on the next page!).
