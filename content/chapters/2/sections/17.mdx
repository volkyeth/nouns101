title: #2. Transfer NFTs
---

Transfer all remaining crypto and NFTs to a secure, uncompromised digital wallet. 

Hopefully you took our advice in Chapter 1, and made two wallets- Hot and Cold storge. 

Try to do this as fast as you can - after all, we don't want hackers snooping around your wallet or transferring out your assets!
