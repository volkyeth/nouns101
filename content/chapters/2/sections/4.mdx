Secondary Purchases When buying off secondary markets, you are purchasing an NFT from another person.

Head over to an <Nutshell children="NFT Marketplace" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_marketplace.mdx" />, like <Nutshell children="Opensea" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/opensea.mdx" />, or <Nutshell children="Rarible" />, and <Nutshell children="connect" body={<>Some NFT Marketplaces may prompt you to "Sign a Message".            ![](/assets/nutshells/connect.png)            This is part of the wallet connection process, which allows the marketplace to send transaction requests to your wallet.      This prompt should not require you to pay gas fees.</>} /> to the site.

From there, you can explore various collections, <Nutshell children="make offers" body={<>Some NFTs are not listed, so they don't have a price tag on them.      Most marketplaces enable you to give an offer, and should the current owner of the NFT accept your offer, the trade will be executed.</>} /> on NFTs, or purchase them directly.

You will notice that each NFT collection has their own Project Profile on Opensea.
