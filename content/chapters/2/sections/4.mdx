Secondary Purchases When buying off secondary markets, you are purchasing an NFT from another person.

Head over to an <Nutshell children="NFT Marketplace" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_marketplace.mdx" />, like <Nutshell children="Opensea" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/opensea.mdx" />, or <Nutshell children="Rarible" />, and <Nutshell children="connect" /> to the site.

From there, you can explore various collections, <Nutshell children="make offers" />   on NFTs, or purchase them directly.

You will notice that each NFT collection has their own Project Profile on Opensea.
