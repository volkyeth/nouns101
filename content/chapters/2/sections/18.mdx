title: Update Credentials
---

Once that’s done, change your login credentials to the wallet, such as your password, and enable <Nutshell children="two-factor authentication (2FA)." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Two-factor-authentication-2FA.mdx" /> &#x20;

Now, the hacker **should** be locked out ✅

**It is best practice to retire that wallet**, in case vulnerabilities still exist.&#x20;

If the hacker did somehow get your seed-phrase it doesn't matter if your password was changed, **they can still re-gain access to your wallet** and any contents.&#x20;
