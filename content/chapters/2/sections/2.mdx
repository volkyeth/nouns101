To buy an NFT, you will need some crypto and a <Tooltip label="We've covered how to set up a crypto wallet in the previous section. Click to go back there"><Link href="/chapters/1/4">crypto wallet</Link></Tooltip>.

If a friend wants to send you an NFT, simply pass them your wallet address.

For buying an NFT, there are 2 main methods: Secondary sales & Minting.

**Secondary Purchases**
When buying off secondary markets, you are purchasing an NFT from another person.

Head over to an [[NFT Marketplace]], and <Nutshell term="Connecting"><Connecting/></Nutshell> to the site.

From there, you can explore various collections, <Nutshell term="make offers on NFTs"><MakeOffers/></Nutshell>, or purchase them directly.

**Minting**
Minting in simple terms means creating an NFT on the blockchain.

So, you are the first owner of an NFT if you mint it.

You may have to pay higher gas fees to mint an NFT, compared to buying one off secondary marketplaces.

In [[NFT auctions]], you are minting NFTs most of the time. An example would be "settling auctions" on [Lil Nouns' website](https://lilnouns.wtf/).
