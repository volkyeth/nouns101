NFTs consist of an image (usually) and its [[metadata]].
 
Metadata is the distinguishing factor of NFTs. In most cases, the metadata of an NFT points to a link, [[off-chain]], where the image actually resides.

For simpler understanding, the "art" of an NFT may not be unique. But the NFT's metadata is.
 
NFTs are not limited to JPEGs; GIFs, soundtracks, and other file forms can also be NFTs.
