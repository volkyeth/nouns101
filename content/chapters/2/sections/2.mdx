# So What’s Under The Artwork?

NFTs consist of an image (usually) and its \[\[metadata]].&#x20;

Of course, NFTs are not limited to JPEGs; GIFs, soundtracks, and other media file forms can also be NFTs.

Metadata is the distinguishing factor of NFTs. For simpler understanding, the "art" of an NFT may not be unique. But the NFT's metadata is.

Note: Add image here.

In most cases, the metadata of an NFT points to a link, \[\[off-chain]], where the image actually resides. However, some NFT collections also reside fully on the blockchain, or what we call \[\[on-chain]].
