title: So Whatâ€™s Under The Artwork?
---

NFTs consist of an image (usually) and its <Nutshell children="metadata." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_metadata.mdx" />

Metadata is the distinguishing factor of NFTs.

**In many cases, but not all,** the metadata of an NFT points to a link, <Nutshell children="off-chain," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/off_chain.mdx" /> where the image actually resides.&#x20;

[This article](https://vonnie610.medium.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nfts-be2601d09cf5) on NFTs, by Veronica Coutts breaks this process down simply.

**In other cases,** the artwork can be **generated and stored on-chain**, like [Nouns](http://www.nouns.wtf). Here is a great article on why Gnars DAO thinks on-chain artwork is the better solution: [https://gnars.com/on-chain-nfts-and-why-theyre-better/](https://gnars.com/on-chain-nfts-and-why-theyre-better/)\*\*\*\*

**NFTs are not limited to JPEGs;** GIFs, soundtracks, and other file forms can also be NFTs.

It's important to understand that NFTs also have <Nutshell children="smart contracts" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Smart-Contract.mdx" /> at their core. Meaning when you interact with an NFT you are interacting with the underlying code, not just the visual image.&#x20;
