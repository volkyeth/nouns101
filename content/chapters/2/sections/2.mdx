title: So Whatâ€™s Under The Artwork?
---

NFTs consist of an image (usually) and its <Nutshell children="metadata" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_metadata.mdx" />.

Metadata is the distinguishing factor of NFTs. In most cases, the metadata of an NFT points to a link, <Nutshell children="off-chain," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/off_chain.mdx" /> where the image actually resides.

In other cases, the artwork can be stored on-chain, like [Nouns](http://www.nouns.wtf).

For simpler understanding, the "art" of an NFT may not be unique. **But the NFT's metadata is.**

NFTs are not limited to JPEGs; GIFs, soundtracks, and other file forms can also be NFTs.

It's important to understand that NFTs also have <Nutshell children="smart contracts" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Smart-Contract.mdx" /> at their core. Meaning when you interact with an NFT you are interacting with the underlying code, not just the visual image.&#x20;
