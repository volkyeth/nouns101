title: Sending/Recieving NFTs
---

To send or recieve an NFT, you'll need the recipient's wallet address, and some crypto to pay gas fees.

Your <Nutshell children="public key" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/public_key.mdx" />  is your wallet address, and what the sender will need to transfer an NFT.

For some digital wallets (like Metamask), you can only see your NFT via their mobile app.

If you're on a desktop computer you should find a <Nutshell children="third-party" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/CH2-third-party-platform.mdx" /> platform or <Nutshell children="marketplace" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_marketplace.mdx" /> to transfer your NFTs.

On Opensea, you simply choose the respective NFT you’d like to send, and hit “Transfer.”

Next, you’ll be prompted to input a wallet address, and then sign a transaction to initiate the transfer on the blockchain.
