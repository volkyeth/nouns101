title: Sending NFTs 
---

To send an NFT, you need the recipient's wallet address, and some crypto to pay gas fees.
 
For some digital wallets (like Metamask), you can only see your NFT via their mobile app.
 
If you're on a desktop computer you should find a [[third-party]] platform or [[marketplace]] to transfer your NFTs. 
 
On Opensea, you simply choose the respective NFT you’d like to send, and hit “Transfer.” 
 
Next, you’ll be prompted to input a wallet address, and then sign a transaction to initiate the [[transfer]] on the blockchain.
