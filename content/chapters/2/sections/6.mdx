title: Sending NFTs
---

To send an NFT, you need the recipient's wallet address, and some crypto to pay gas fees.

For some digital wallets (like Metamask), you can only see your NFT via their mobile app.

If you're on a desktop computer you should find a <Nutshell children="third-party" /> platform or <Nutshell children="marketplace" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_marketplace.mdx" /> to transfer your NFTs.

On Opensea, you simply choose the respective NFT you’d like to send, and hit “Transfer.”

Next, you’ll be prompted to input a wallet address, and then sign a transaction to initiate the <Nutshell children="transfer" /> on the blockchain.
