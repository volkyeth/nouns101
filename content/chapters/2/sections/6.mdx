title: Receiving/Sending  NFTs
---

To send or recieve an NFT, you'll need the recipient's wallet address, and some crypto to pay gas fees.

Your <Nutshell children="public key" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/public_key.mdx" />  is your wallet address, and what the sender will need to transfer an NFT.&#x20;

**For MetaMask**, you can navigate to your Google Chrome Extension and simply click your Account's wallet address to copy to your clipboard —&#x20;

**Once you have someone's public key, you can transfer them NFTs.**

For some digital wallets (like Metamask), you can only see your NFT via their mobile app.

If you're on a desktop computer you should find a <Nutshell children="third-party" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/CH2-third-party-platform.mdx" /> platform or <Nutshell children="marketplace" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/nft_marketplace.mdx" /> to transfer your NFTs.

On a NFT Marketplace like <Nutshell children="Opensea" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/opensea.mdx" />, you simply choose the respective NFT you’d like to send, and hit “Transfer.”

Next, you’ll be prompted to input a wallet address, and then sign a transaction to initiate the transfer on the blockchain.
