title: #4. Damage Control

From here, it’s time to assess the damage. If the hacker has drained the wallet despite your best efforts, it’s best to abandon it entirely. While it’s impossible to reverse the transactions, there still are ways to recover your stolen funds.

You add “making a police report” to your checklist. Remember to scan your devices for malware, report the hacker to your wallet provider, and check with your bank to ensure no suspicious transactions are taking place. Finally, you can follow the money trail… courtesy of the blockchain.

If the hacker happens to transfer funds to an exchange, you can contact the exchange to notify them of the situation. A last resort would be to post this unfortunate situation to crypto hack platforms or even Crypto Twitter, and let others know of the hackers out there. Just a reminder that this will attract other hackers to your DMs… so stay alert!
