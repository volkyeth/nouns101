title: WTF Is An NFT?

NFT stands for [[Non Fungible Token]]. Was that any clearer? Haha!
 
NFTs are essentially digital tokens on the blockchain, but they are one-of-a-kind.

Note: Add image here.

Even if two NFTs look exactly the same, cryptographically, they are different. Think of this like a serial number identifying and differentiating two cars.
