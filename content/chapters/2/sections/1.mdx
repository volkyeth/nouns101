title: WTF Is An NFT?
---

NFT stands for [[Non Fungible Token]]. Was that any clearer? Haha.

NFTs are essentially digital tokens on the blockchain, but they are one-of-a-kind.

Even if two NFTs look exactly the same, cryptographically, they are different.

**The Details**

NFTs consist of an image (usually) and its [[nft metadata: metadata]].

Metadata is the distinguishing factor of NFTs. In most cases, the metadata of an NFT points to a link, [[off-chain]], where the image actually resides.

For simpler understanding, the "art" of an NFT may not be unique. But the NFT's metadata is.

NFTs are not limited to JPEGs; GIFs, soundtracks, and other file forms can also be NFTs.
