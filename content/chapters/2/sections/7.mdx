Having a specific recipient is not necessary when selling NFTs.

Most commonly, you list your NFT on NFT marketplaces, and wait for potential buyers to give offers, or buy it outright.

You may have to pay a commission fee to the marketplace for facilitating the transaction and <Nutshell children="royalties" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/royalties.mdx" /> to the creators.

On Opensea, after selecting an NFT and hitting “SELL” you’ll be prompted with a window like this:

Note: Add image here.

Here, you’ll be able to choose a Fixed Price sale, or Auction.

Next, you will enter in your sale price (or auction reserve), and how long the NFT will be listed for (or how long the auction will last).

You’ll also have your total earnings displayed, after fees are taken from the sale.

If it’s your first time selling an NFT from that collection, you may be promoted by the platform to sign two transactions. The first to <Nutshell children="allow access to the collection" />, and the second to initiate the sale.
