NFTs come in all sizes and formats.

They can differ in <Nutshell term="art & style"><ArtStyle/></Nutshell>, <Nutshell term="file format"><FileFormat/></Nutshell>, <Nutshell term="use cases"><UseCases/></Nutshell>, and more.

But these differences merely exist on the surface. Let's explore NFTs with differing ownership models.

**CC0 vs I.P.**
Most NFTs have Intellectual Property (I.P.) Rights. For some collections, artists reserve rights, while others transfer I.P. to buyers of the NFT.

NFTs with I.P. give you exclusive rights to use and commercialize your NFT. In other words, copyright.

Admist all the controversy and confusion in NFT I.P., a new solution has come to the table - [[CC0]], or Creative Commons Zero.

This exact opposite of I.P. is adopted by few projects, including Lil Nouns DAO.
