DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

In plain english, a group of people governing an entity, without the <Nutshell children="traditional hierarchical structure" body={<>Most corporations follow a hierarchy, with the CEO and Board of Directors at the top, trickling down to executives, managers, and the common worker.      The DAO abolishes this.      Instead, everyone has a seat at the decision-making table.      However, this doesn't mean that everybody is "equal". This heavily depends on how invested you are in a DAO.</>} />.
