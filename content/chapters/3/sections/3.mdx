title: Why People Collect NFTs
---

The “[[utility]]” of an NFT refers to the value you get out of buying, and [[holding]] a particular project. 
 
In many cases NFTs are just digital collectables, and artists offer zero utility aside from [[!vibes]]. While other NFTs could give you a wide variety of perks:
- The “[[NFT community]].”
- Access to private chats, tools, or information you’re seeking.
- Act as tickets to, or for, events.
- Gain you access to [[whitelists]] or free NFTs.
- Allow you to vote  in DAO [[governance]].
