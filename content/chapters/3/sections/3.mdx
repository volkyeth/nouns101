DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

In plain english, a group of people governing an entity, without the <Nutshell term="traditional hierarchical structure"><Traditional/></Nutshell>.

**The Details**
You can think of a DAO as an entity where every member is personally invested in its success.

That is because everyone has a stake in a DAO. You join a DAO by <Nutshell term="buying a token"><Buying/></Nutshell> to enter the organization.

As there is no central governing body in a DAO, all members vote and <Nutshell term="govern"><Governance/></Nutshell> it collectively.

[[Smart contracts]] make sure that decisions made by a DAO are righfully executed. No under-the-table deals here, all transactions are made public (on the blockchain).
