DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

In plain english, a group of people governing an entity, without the [[traditional hierarchical structure]].

**The Details**
You can think of a DAO as an entity where every member is personally invested in its success.

That is because everyone has a stake in a DAO. You join a DAO by [[buying a token]] to enter the organization.

As there is no central governing body in a DAO, all members vote and [[govern]] it collectively.

[[Smart contracts]] make sure that decisions made by a DAO are righfully executed. No under-the-table deals here, all transactions are made public (on the blockchain).
