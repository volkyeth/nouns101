**Beware of:**

▫ <Nutshell children="Pump and Dump" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/CH3-Pump-and-dump.mdx" />  schemes.

▫ **Scam** web3 communities.

▫ **Fake** Twitter accounts posing as real projects.

▫ Messages from **fake** ‘BOT verification’ after joining a community.

▫ Anyone **asking you for personal information**, seed phrase, etc..

One rule of thumb is to **close your Direct Messages**, only allowing messages from those you add as a friend.

**Remember: If it’s too good to be true, it probably is!**

**Unsure? — Ask** someone publicly before signing any transactions- No questions are bad questions. Most web3 communities are very open and willing to help newcomers 🤝
