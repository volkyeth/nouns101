**Beware of:**

▫ <Nutshell children="Pump and Dump" />  schemes.

▫ Scam web3 communities.

▫ Fake Twitter accounts posing as real projects.

▫ Messages from fake ‘BOT verification’ after joining a community.

▫ Anyone asking you for personal information, seed phrase, etc..

One rule of thumb is to close your Direct Messages, only allowing messages from those you add as a friend.

**Remember:** If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.

If you're unsure, ask someone before signing any transactions. Most web3 communities are very open and willing to help newcomers 🤝
