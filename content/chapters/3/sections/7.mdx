title: How DAO’s Work
---

You can think of a DAO as an entity where every member is personally invested in its success.
That is because everyone has a stake in a DAO. 
 
There is no central governing body in a DAO, all members vote and [[govern]] it collectively. 
 
Most DAOs control [[treasuries]], where assets are distributed based on the votes cast by its members. 
 
In the case of NounsDAO protocol (which we’ll dive more into in the next chapter), after each token is sold 100% of the ETH is automatically sent to the treasury. Other DAOs may function differently. 
 
[[Smart contracts]] make sure that decisions made by a DAO are [[trustless]]. No under-the-table deals here, all transactions are made public (on the blockchain).
