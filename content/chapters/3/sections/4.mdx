title: Web3 Communities
---



In the web3 space there are many different types of communities.

Many of these communities started surrounding <Nutshell children="defi," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/defi.mdx" /> and crypto investing, and have adopted a number of platforms for communicating with other <Nutshell children="holders." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/holder.mdx" />

As NFT projects began to be created, these communities quickly became a standard for projects, collections, and DAOs (more on DAO’s in the next section).

Many are free to join, while others may require you to own a NFT before entering, this is called <Nutshell children="token gating." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/token_gated.mdx" />

## Main places you’ll find NFT communities:

▫ <Nutshell children="Discord Servers" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Discord.mdx" />&#x20;

▫ Twitter

▫ Telegram

▫ Or even on native web3 apps like [farcaster.xyz](https://www.farcaster.xyz/)

In most cases, official links to these communities can be found on the official project website, or Twitter pages.
