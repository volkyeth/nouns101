Most NFTs have Intellectual Property (I.P.) Rights. For some collections, artists reserve rights, while others transfer I.P. to buyers of the NFT.

NFTs with I.P. give you exclusive rights to use and commercialize your particular NFT, freely, or within a <Nutshell children="limited set of rights" />.

In other cases projects have started to remove these I.P. rights, and release their content as \[\[CC0]], or Creative Commons Zero.

CC0 has been hailed as one important factor in the growth of web3 — Allowing creators to build off of each other’s work; Art, code, or protocol.

Some NFT communities have made this a core pillar of their ethos, like the Cryptoadz, NounsDAO, and many of the other Nounish sub-DAO’s.

For example, those square glasses (\[\[Noggles]]) you might keep seeing across NFT projects, and throughout Nouns101, are fully CC0, and have No Rights Reserved for the creators.
