The web3 space is brutal. To survive bear markets and long-drawn recessions, you probably need a community to keep you afloat in bad times.

Perhaps it's time to join a web3 community.

**The Details**

Web3 Communities are versatile and serve different audiences.

There are free Discord/Telegram groups focusing on specific areas of web3. For beginners, you can begin there since most are free to join.

As you collect NFTs and Cryptocurrencies, soon enough, you would be part of a [[DAO]]. You can take part in governance and interact with like-minded holders in DAOs.

Beware of scam web3 communities! There are many malicious groups out there looking to cheat your money through [[Pump and Dump]] schemes.
