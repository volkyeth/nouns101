Now that you've learned about the blockchain, and have bought some crypto you'll need to understand **Transactions**. <Nutshell children="transactions." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/transaction.mdx" />

Because the blockchain is decentralized, whenever a user wants to interact with the blockchain different transactions (aka txn's) are required.&#x20;

**For example:** Sending, minting, or purchasing NFTs from a Marketplace come alongside transactions that cost <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/gas_fee.mdx" children="gas fees." />&#x20;

These transaction fees fluctuate depending on how much traffic there is on that particular blockchain, at any given time.&#x20;
