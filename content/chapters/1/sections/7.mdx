Now that you've learned about the blockchain, and have bought some crypto you'll need to understand <Nutshell children="transactions." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/transaction.mdx" />&#x20;

All of these transactions are public and recorded on the blockchain.&#x20;

In many cases transactions **(aka txn's)** like sending, minting, or purchasing NFTs from a Marketplace come alongside transactions that have <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/gas_fee.mdx" children="gas fees." />&#x20;

Gas fees, also known as transaction fees, are fees paid in the native crypto of a blockchain network (ie: Ethereum, etc..) to <Nutshell children="Crypto Miners" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Crypto-Miner.mdx" />  in order to have a transaction processed and added to the blockchain. The amount of gas fees required for a transaction can fluctuate due to competition for block space on the blockchain (when demand for transactions is high, more miners compete to validate and add them, leading to higher fees to incentivize miners) and other factors such as the complexity of a transaction and market dynamics.



These fees fluctuate depending on how much traffic there is on that particular blockchain, at any given time. Why? â€” Because the blockchain is a decentralized body, independent  <Nutshell children="Crypto Miners" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Crypto-Miner.mdx" /> share the workload and receive rewards for keeping the blockchain validated. These rewards are paid through gas fees.&#x20;

For the Ethereum blockchain you can check these gas fees on Etherscan, [here](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).&#x20;

As you are prompted to sign a transaction these gas fee's will appear alongside the <Nutshell children="transaction details" /> .
