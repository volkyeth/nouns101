title: Multiple Wallets & Safety
---


**It’s good practice to open multiple wallets. Why?** — Beyond investors using them for different blockchains (bitcoin vs ethereum), it’s smart when you’re actively connecting to DAAPs) where your wallet could become vulnerable.

**In many cases people have two wallets;**

**Wallet #1** is their main wallet. In many cases a <Nutshell children="Hardware Wallet," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/hardware_wallet.mdx" /> like Ledger. This wallet stores all (or most) of someone’s crypto and digital assets, like NFTs. You don't interact with this wallet,  just use it to store tokens and digital assets.&#x20;

**Wallet #2** is considered a <Nutshell children="Hot Wallet." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/hot_wallet.mdx" />  This is your active wallet where you buy NFTs, connect to <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/dapp.mdx" children="dApps," /> and more. Because you use it so much, you don’t keep a lot of assets on it, but rather use it to buy, and then send new assets to Wallet #1.

**Why is this Important?**
In Chapter 2 we’ll review how hackers can gain access to your wallet, common methods, and how to stay safe. The importance of two wallets is part of this process, along with using a Ledger, and something we’ll dive deeper into in Chapter 2!
