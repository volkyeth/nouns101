The blockchain is a \[\[decentralized database]], using <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/dlt.mdx" />\[\[Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)]] to share transaction information among \[\[nodes]] of a network.

All transactions on the blockchain are \[\[fully transparent]].

Electronic data is stored as “blocks”, and once a block is full, a new block is generated.

Blocks are linked with cryptographic technology, forming the blockchain.

Once recorded and validated, data on the blockchain cannot be edited, erased, or reversed.
