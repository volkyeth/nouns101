The blockchain is a decentralized database, using <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/dlt.mdx" children="Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)" />  to share transaction information among nodes of a network.

All transactions on the blockchain are fully transparent, and recorded for anyone to view.

Electronic data is stored as *“blocks”,* and once a block is full, a new block is generated.

Blocks are linked with cryptographic technology, forming the blockchain.

Once recorded and validated, data on the blockchain cannot be edited, erased, or reversed.&#x20;
