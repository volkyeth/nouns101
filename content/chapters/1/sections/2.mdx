Blockchain is the backbone of Web3. Without it, crypto, NFTs, and DAOs would not exist.

Fundamentally, the blockchain is a database.

## The Details

The blockchain is a [[decentralized database]], using [[Distributed Ledger Technology:Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)]] to share transaction information among [[nodes]] of a network.

All transactions on the blockchain are [[fully transparent]].

Electronic data is stored as “blocks”, and once a block is full, a new block is generated. Blocks are linked with cryptographic technology, forming the blockchain.

Once recorded and validated, data on the blockchain cannot be edited, erased, or reversed.
