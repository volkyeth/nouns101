title: Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets
---

As explained in the previously, there are different types of crypto wallets.&#x20;

After purchasing your crypto on an exchange, we suggest you *store* your crypto long term on a <Nutshell children="non-custodial wallet." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Non-custodial-Crypto-Wallet.mdx" /> Doing so allows you to secure your crypto on the <Nutshell children="blockchain," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/blockchain.mdx" /> and not in an exchange.&#x20;

A **custodial wallet** service (like Coinbase or Kraken) holds on to the private key, so it is responsible for safeguarding a user's funds.&#x20;

While a **non-custodial wallet,** on the other hand, gives users full control over their private key, and with it sole responsibility for protecting their holdings.&#x20;

**Q:** What's wrong with keeping your crypto in an exchange (or custodial wallet)? â€” **In most cases, nothing.** But, a common phrase used in Web3 is ["Not your keys, not your coins."](https://www.ledger.com/academy/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-why-it-matters) **Meaning;** if you don't hold the private key to the wallet, someone else does, and your crypto could potentially become vulnerable like in the case of [FTX](https://www.investopedia.com/ftx-exchange-5200842).
