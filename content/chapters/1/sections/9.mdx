There are many types of software wallets (aka <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/hot_wallet.mdx" children="Hot Wallets" /> ), and it’s important to do research to determine which is best suited for you.

For the purposes of this course, we’re suggesting you set up an Ethereum wallet through <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/metamask.mdx" children="MetaMask" />.&#x20;

**Please take your time creating your digital wallet now.**

This should take approximately 10-15 minutes.

Visit [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/) -or- **find MetaMask in the app store** to get started.&#x20;

**Simply follow the on screen steps.** We also recommend you watch this video for a walk through before or as you get started:
