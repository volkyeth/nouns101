# Software Wallets

There are many types of software wallets (aka \[\[hot wallets]]), and it’s important to do research to determine which is best suited for you.

For the purposes of this course, we’re suggesting you set up an Ethereum wallet through \[\[MetaMask]]. Please take your time creating your digital wallet now. This should take approximately 5-10 minutes.

Visit https://metamask.io/ or find metamask in the app store to get started. Simply follow the on screen steps, or watch this video for a walk through before or as you get started:

**Note:** It is very very important you NEVER share the seed phrase you create when setting up your wallet. I repeat — **NEVER**.
