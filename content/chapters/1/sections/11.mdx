<Nutshell children="Hardware Wallets" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/hardware_wallet.mdx" />  house your <Nutshell children="private key" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/private_key.mdx" />  on a physical device, making it almost impossible for a hacker to retrieve.&#x20;

Unlike <Nutshell children="software wallets," glossaryEntry="content/glossary/software_wallet.mdx" />  with a hardware wallet your private key and seed phrase are not generated on a computer that has access to the internet. They are created on the device itself.&#x20;

Doing this limits the risks of hacks or vulnerabilities on ones personal machine, and being connected to the internet.&#x20;

**Hardware Safety**

Itâ€™s important to always buy hardware wallets **directly from the manufacturer** to avoid security risks and vulnerabilities.&#x20;

**Two popular, and trusted**, hardware wallet brands are Ledger ([https://www.ledger.com/](https://www.ledger.com/)) and Trezor ([https://trezor.io/)](https://trezor.io/).
