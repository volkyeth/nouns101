It's time to set up your first Non-Custodial Crypto Wallet! Here, we'll create a <Nutshell children="software wallet" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/software_wallet.mdx" /> !

For the purposes of this course, we’re suggesting you set up an Ethereum wallet through <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/metamask.mdx" children="MetaMask." />

**Please take your time creating your digital wallet now.**

This should take approximately 10-15 minutes.
