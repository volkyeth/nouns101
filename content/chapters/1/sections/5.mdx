Interacting with the blockchain is done by executing various types of <Nutshell children="transactions." glossaryEntry="content/glossary/transaction.mdx" />&#x20;

**All of these transactions are public and recorded on the blockchain.**

In many cases transactions (aka txn's), such as sending crypto or purchasing NFTs from a Marketplace, have <Nutshell glossaryEntry="content/glossary/gas_fee.mdx" children="gas fees." />&#x20;

**Gas fees (aka transaction fees),** are fees paid in the native crypto of a blockchain network (ie: Ethereum, etc..) to <Nutshell children="Crypto Miners" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Crypto-Miner.mdx" />  in order to have a transaction processed and added to the blockchain.&#x20;

**Gas fees can fluctuate per transaction** due to competition for block space on the blockchain (when demand for transactions is high, more miners compete to validate and add them, leading to higher fees to incentivize miners), along with other factors such as the complexity of a transaction and market dynamics.&#x20;

For the Ethereum blockchain, you can check these gas fees on Etherscan, [here](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).&#x20;

As you are prompted to sign a transaction these gas fees will appear alongside the <Nutshell children="transaction details" glossaryEntry="content/glossary/Transaction-Details.mdx" />.
