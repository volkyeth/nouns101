Cryptocurrency is an [[intangible]], digital currency on the blockchain.

This means that crypto is not run by governments or banks. Crypto is run decentrally.

**The Details**
Cryptocurrency relies on blockchain technology to be secured, transferred, and created.

Cryptocurrency is [[stored]], and can be bought with [[FIAT]] on crypto exchanges.
