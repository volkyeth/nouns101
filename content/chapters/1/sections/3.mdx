The blockchain is **transparent, immutable, and decentralized**. Because of that, it cannot be easily manipulated by malicious parties, nor managed by a central authority.

As such, the blockchain allows us to trust the authenticity of transactions - with a [[trustless]] system, in an untrustworthy world.

Security and feasibility is a given, but blockchain technology gives us something better: accountability and reliability. Blockchain, the better system.
