# Your First POAP

POAP is an acronym that stands for "Proof of Attendance Protocol". POAP is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that is used to create and distribute non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as proof of attendance for events and conferences. POAP allows event organizers to create unique NFTs for each attendee, which can be collected and verified using a blockchain-based smart contract.

To collect your first free NFT, in the form of a POAP, simply go to the app store and download the POAP app.&#x20;

There, you'll connect the wallet you created in the previous section and begin to collect POAPs when you finish Nouns101 chapters, attend events, twitter spaces or more!
